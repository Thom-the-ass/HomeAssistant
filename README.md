# A simple Flask based home assistant

This project integrates ESP32 devices with a Flask web server to control GPIO Pins via web-based interactions. It enables seamless real-time device management using simplified JSON-based data exchange. 

This is a work in progress with the aim to develop fully open source and hobby friendly hardware and software that users can use to improve their understanding of networking and IOT devices.
